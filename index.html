  <h1> Where is season 2?!</h1>
 <p>The Operative: I want to resolve this like civilized men. I'm not threatening you. I'm unarmed.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Good.  [pulls gun and shoots Operative in the chest, knocking him into the wall, grabs Inara and gets ready to leave]  The Operative: [grabs Mal from behind] I am, however, wearing full body armor. I am not a moron!</p>
 <p class="second">Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Just get us on the ground!  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: That part'll happen pretty definitely.</p>
 <p>Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [First lines, camera pans around Serenity in re-entry and a panel flies off the nose] What aws that?  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: Did you see that?  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Was that the primary buffer panel?  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: It did seem to resemble...  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Did the primary buffer panel just fall off my gorram ship for no apparent reason?  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: [Checks his instruments] Looks like.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: I thought Kaylee checked the entry couplings. I've a very clear recollection of it.  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: Well, if she doesn't get us some extra flow from the engine room to offset the burn-through, this landing is gonna get pretty interesting.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Define "interesting."  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: [Deadpan] Oh God, oh God, we're all gonna die.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [Grabs PA microphone] This is the captain. We're having a little problem with our entry sequence, so we may experience some slight turbulence and then... explode.  [Hangs up microphone]  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Can you shave the vector?  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: I'm doing it, it's not enough.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Well, just get us on the ground.  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: That part'll happen pretty definitely.</p>
 <p>Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: It's okay, I'm a leaf on the wind!  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: What does that mean?</p>
 <p>Inara Serra: You came to the training house looking for a fight.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: I came looking for you.  Inara Serra: I just want to know who I'm dealing with. I've seen too many versions of you to be sure.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [moves closer to Inara] I start fighting a war. I guarantee you'll see something new.</p>
